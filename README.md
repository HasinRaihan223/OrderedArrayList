# OrderedArrayList
Our breakout group discussed some subtle nuances about the lab and some of the submission guidelines. Some people were confused about what the "edit readme.md file" actually meant. A lot of us were confused about how exactly implement the constructors, so we had a little discussion about that and thought we should just call super for their initialization.
